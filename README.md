A memorizing technique with emojis



I should explain it with a poem as an example. Let's take a look at this poem:

”No Man Is an Island” by John Donne

No man is an island, entire of itself;<br>
every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
a part of the main.

If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
Europe is the less,<br>
as well as if a promontory were,<br>
as well as if a manor of thy friend’s<br>
or of thine own were.

Any man’s death diminishes me,<br>
because I am involved in mankind;<br>
and therefore never send to know<br>
for whom the bell tolls;<br>
it tolls for thee.

------------------
So We take the first letter of every line. So the poem becomes:<br>
<div style="padding-bottom:10px;">Nea <br>
IEaao <br>
Abafi <br>
</div><br>

and put it in <a href="https://gansanta.github.io/learn-with-emoji/">this link</a> <br>

And we get the emojis:
<div style="font-size:36px;">🍜🦅👽 <br>
🍦🦅👽👽🍊<br>
👽🦇👽🔥🍦</div>

Just look at the emojis and try to remember the first letter. Hope it helps.
